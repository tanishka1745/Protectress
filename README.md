* Prevention and Awareness: The app can educate users on safety tips, potential dangers, and self-defense techniques, thereby preventing incidents before they occur.

* Emergency Assistance: Providing quick access to emergency contacts, authorities, and real-time location sharing can ensure timely help in critical situations.

* Empowerment: Empowering women with tools and information to take control of their safety can build confidence and reduce anxiety related to personal security.
